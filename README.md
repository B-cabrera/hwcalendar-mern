# HwCalendar
A web application where you can add HW with due dates based on class and be reminded using (NOT YET CHOSEN).

## Description
A personal project to practice developing a web application with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

### Ideas
- Integration with Google Calendar using API.
- User Auth to allow for individual calendars/reminders

### Reminders
- [ ] Add cancel button when adding class and hw
- [ ] Fix UI to be view perfectly on different screen sizes.
- [ ] Getting a fixed number of hws and class at once, essentially dividing all into "pages"
  - [ ] OR allowing scrolling to see all classes/hws

### Progress
Current Phase: Implementing the ability to update class name  
Next Phase: Fixing problems
